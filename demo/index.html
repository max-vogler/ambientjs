    <p>Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, which are the seeds of berries from the Coffea
        plant. The Coffea plant is native to subtropical Africa and some islands in southern Asia. The plant was
        exported from Africa to countries around the world and coffee plants are now cultivated in over 70 countries,
        primarily in the equatorial regions of the Americas, Southeast Asia, India, and Africa. The two most commonly
        grown are the highly regarded arabica, and the less sophisticated but stronger and more hardy robusta. Once
        ripe, coffee beans are picked, processed, and dried. Green (unroasted) coffee beans are one of the most traded
        agricultural commodities in the world. Once traded, the coffee beans are roasted to varying degrees, depending
        on the desired flavor. Roasted beans are ground and brewed produce coffee as a beverage.</p>

    <p>Coffee is slightly acidic and can have a stimulating effect on humans because of its caffeine content. Coffee is
        one of the most popular drinks in the world. It can be prepared and presented in a variety of ways (e.g.,
        espresso, cappuccino, cafe latte, etc.). It is usually served hot, although iced coffee is also served. The
        majority of recent research suggests that moderate coffee consumption is benign or mildly beneficial in healthy
        adults.</p>

    <p>Coffee cultivation first took place in Ethiopia. The earliest credible evidence of coffee-drinking appears in
        the middle of the 15th century in the Sufi shrines of Yemen. In the Horn of Africa and Yemen, coffee was used
        in local religious ceremonies. As these ceremonies conflicted with the beliefs of the Christian church, the
        Ethiopian Church banned the secular consumption of coffee until the reign of Emperor Menelik II. The beverage
        was also banned in Ottoman Turkey during the 17th century for political reasons, and was associated with
        rebellious political activities in Europe.</p>

    <p>Coffee is a major export commodity: it is the top agricultural export for numerous countries and among the
        world's largest legal agricultural export. and one of the most valuable commodities exported by developing
        countries. Green (unroasted) coffee is one of the most traded agricultural commodities in the world. Some
        controversy is associated with coffee cultivation and its impact on the environment. Consequently, fair trade
        coffee and organic coffee are an expanding market.</p>
